Feature: PV2-688 - New Apprenticeship Approved
	As an Employer
	I want the Payments Calc Data-Locks process to be made aware of newly approved commitments
	So that they can be matched to the ILR Learner and allow payments to be made for the learner

Scenario Outline: PV2-688 - New Apprenticeship Approved
	Given the following employers
		| Identifier       | Legal Entity Name | Agreement Id |
		| Employer A       | Test Employer     | 12345        |
		| Sending Employer | Sender            | 54321        |
	And the following apprenticeships have been approved with Employer Type "<Employer Type>"
		| Identifier       | Created On Date              | Agreed On Date               | Learner   | Provider   | Employer   | Sending Employer | Standard Code | Programme Type | Framework Code | Pathway Code | Start date                   | End date                     |
		| Apprenticeship A | 01/Aug/Current Academic Year | 01/Aug/Current Academic Year | Learner A | Provider A | Employer A | Sending Employer | 20            | 20             | 593            | 1            | 01/Aug/Current Academic Year | 01/Aug/Current Academic Year |
	And the apprenticeships have the following price episodes
		| Apprenticeship   | Agreed Price | Effective From               |
		| Apprenticeship A | 10000        | 01/Aug/Current Academic Year |
	When the Approvals service notifies the Payments service of the apprenticeships
	Then the Payments service should record the apprenticeships
