#Non-Levy apprentice, provider changes ULN for an apprentice in the ILR after payments have already occurred
#
#        Given the apprenticeship funding band maximum is 9000
#       
#        When an ILR file is submitted for period R01 with the following data:
#		
#			| learner reference number | ULN        | learner type           | agreed price | start date | planned end date | actual end date | completion status | framework code | programme type | pathway code |

#        
#        And an ILR file is submitted for period R03 with the following data:

#        
#        Then the provider earnings and payments break down as follows:

	I want a non-Levy apprentice, provider changes ULN for an apprentice in the ILR after payments have already occurred, to be paid the correct amount
	So that I am accurately paid my apprenticeship provision.

Feature: Non-Levy apprentice, provider changes ULN for an apprentice in the ILR after payments have already occurred

Scenario Outline: Non-levy learner provider changes ULN after payments have already occurred PV2-394
	Given the provider previously submitted the following learner details
