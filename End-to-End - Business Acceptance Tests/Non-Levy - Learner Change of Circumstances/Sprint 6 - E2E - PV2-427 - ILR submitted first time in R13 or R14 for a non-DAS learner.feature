#Issues in Spec:
# 09/19 is incorrect
#
#Scenario: ILR submitted late for a non-DAS learner
#		
#Given the apprenticeship funding band maximum for each learner is 17000
#When a provider submits an ILR several months after learning has started (after the academic year boundary), 
#the earnings calculation is updated retrospectively and the provider gets paid for the preceding months.
#	 
#		When an ILR file is submitted for the first time on 28/08/19 with the following data:
#		
#            | ULN       | learner type       | agreed price | start date | planned end date | completion status |
#            | learner a | programme only DAS | 15000        | 01/09/2018 | 08/09/2019       | continuing        |
#       
#	   Then the provider earnings and payments break down as follows:
#	   
#            | Type                          			|09/18| ... | 04/19 | 05/19 | 06/19 | 07/19 | 08/19 | 09/19 |
