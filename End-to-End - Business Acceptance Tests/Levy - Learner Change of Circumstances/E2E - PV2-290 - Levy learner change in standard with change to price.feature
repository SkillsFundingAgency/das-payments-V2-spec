#Background:
#        Given The learner is programme only DAS
#        And the apprenticeship funding band maximum is 17000
#        And levy balance > agreed price for all months
#
#    Scenario: Earnings and payments for a DAS learner, levy available, where the apprenticeship standard changes
#        Given the following commitments exist on 03/12/2018:
#            | commitment Id | version Id | ULN       | standard code | start date | end date   | agreed price | effective from | effective to |
#            | 1             | 1-001      | learner a | 51            | 01/08/2018 | 01/08/2019 | 15000        | 01/08/2018     | 31/10/2018   |
#            | 1             | 1-002      | learner a | 52            | 01/08/2018 | 01/08/2019 | 5625         | 03/11/2018     |              |
#        When an ILR file is submitted with the following data:
#            | ULN       | standard code | start date | planned end date | actual end date | completion status | Total training price | Total training price effective date | Total assessment price | Total assessment price effective date |
#            | learner a | 51            | 03/08/2018 | 01/08/2019       | 31/10/2018      | withdrawn         | 12000                | 03/08/2018                          | 3000                   | 03/08/2017                            |
#            | learner a | 52            | 03/11/2018 | 01/08/2019       |                 | continuing        | 4500                 | 03/11/2018                          | 1125                   | 03/11/2017                            |
#        #Then the data lock status of the ILR in 03/12/2018 is:
#        #    | Payment type | 08/18               | 09/18               | 10/18               | 11/18               | 12/18               |
#        #    | On-program   | commitment 1 v1-001 | commitment 1 v1-001 | commitment 1 v1-001 | commitment 1 v1-002 | commitment 1 v1-002 |
#        Then the provider earnings and payments break down as follows:
#            | Type                       | 08/18 | 09/18 | 10/18 | 11/18 | 12/18 |
#            | Provider Earned Total      | 1000  | 1000  | 1000  | 500   | 500   |
#            | Provider Earned from SFA   | 1000  | 1000  | 1000  | 500   | 500   |
#            | Provider Paid by SFA       | 0     | 1000  | 1000  | 1000  | 500   |
#            | Levy account debited       | 0     | 1000  | 1000  | 1000  | 500   |
#            | SFA Levy employer budget   | 1000  | 1000  | 1000  | 500   | 500   |
#            | SFA Levy co-funding budget | 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     |

Scenario Outline: Levy learner change to standard at the end of a month no change in price PV2-290

	Given the employer levy account balance is 15500
	And the provider previously submitted the following learner details
