#Scenario: Non levy learner changes provider but remains with the same employer
#Given The learner is programme only non levy
#And the apprenticeship funding band maximum is 15000
#       
#When the providers submit the following ILR files:
#    | Provider   | ULN       | start date | planned end date | actual end date | completion status | Total training price | Total training price effective date | Total assessment price | Total assessment price effective date |
#    | provider a | learner a | 06/08/2018 | 08/08/2019       | 04/03/2019      | withdrawn         | 6000                 | 06/08/2018                          | 1500                   | 06/08/2018                            |
