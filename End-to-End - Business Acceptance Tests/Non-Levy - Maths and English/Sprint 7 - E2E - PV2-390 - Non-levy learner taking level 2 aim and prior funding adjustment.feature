##Learner taking single level 2 aim, prior funding adjustment, completes to time
##Feature: Provider earnings and payments where apprenticeship requires english or maths at level 2 with funding adjustment - COMPLETES ON TIME
#
#Scenario: A Payment for a non-levy learner, funding agreed within band maximum, planned duration is same as programme (assumes both start and finish at same time)
#	
##	Providers are paid £471 per aim. this is funded from outside the total price and is flat-profiled across the planned number of months in learning for that aim. There is no N+1, there is no money held back for completion. 
##	If the learner has english and maths needs above level 2 (apprenticeship requires higher) this is funded within the total price.
#	
##	Tech Guide 102. If an adjustment is required due to prior learning, you must record data in the Funding adjustment for prior learning field on the ILR. 
#
#	When an ILR file is submitted with the following data:
#		  | ULN       | learner type                 | agreed price | start date | planned end date | actual end date | completion status | funding adjustment for prior learning | other funding adjustment | aim type         |
#		  | learner a | 19-24 programme only non-DAS | 15000        | 06/08/2018 | 08/08/2019       |                 | continuing        | n/a                                   | n/a                      | programme        |

#		  
##    The English or maths aim is submitted with the same start and planned end date
#      
#    Then the provider earnings and payments break down as follows:
