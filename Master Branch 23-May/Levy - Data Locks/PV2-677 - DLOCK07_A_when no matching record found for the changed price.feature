Feature: DLOCK07_A_When price is changed, then effective to is set on previous price episode - PV2-677
		I want to be notified with a DLOCK07(a) when the price is changed, and the effective to is set on previous price episode
		So that I can correct the data mis-match between the Commitment and ILR - PV2-677

Scenario: DLOCK07_A_When price is changed, then effective to is set on previous price episode - PV2-677
